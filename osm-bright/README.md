OSM Smartrak is a fork of the amazing [OSM Bright](https://github.com/mapbox/osm-bright) project. The changes are purely cosmetic, bring the map style a bit closer to a Google Maps style.

This theme is used in Smartrak's in house mapping products.

### TODO

 * Update make.py and configure.py.same to allow choosing either the oms-bright or osm-smartrak.
